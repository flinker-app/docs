### Answers

#### What can I input in the search field?

You can ask anything. Of course it should be relevant to the data in the IFC file. Data which is not in your IFC file cannot be search - this is understandable.

#### What languages are supported for my prompts?

You can prompt and chat with your IFC file in any major World languages. Just as you would do with GPT and other Large language Models (LLMs).

#### Is it secure?

Absolutely, as any of our privacy first Microsoft Add-ons. It is as secure as it could be with Microsoft. Azure AI is an enterpise level security technology and used by the largest organizations worldwide. 

Your data stays with you and your organization! We do not upload your files or data anywhere. This is one of the big benefits when your company works with Microsoft Add-Ons: There is no need to download your data and upload it again in external software platforms.

All processing is client-side, ensuring full privacy and security. For more details, see [Microsoft App Compliance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-app-certification/teams/flinker-gmbh-open-ifc-viewer?pivots=general)
