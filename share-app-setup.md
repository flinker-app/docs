Note: If you have also created Microsoft security groups the SharePoint user groups can be name identical with the existing Microsoft security groups.

## Tips & Tricks

### 3.1 Create Permission Groups as Security Groups

If you operate various projects and you have often times a bunch of same users in a groups you can set up so called security groups for these recurring working (user) groups. This will make your live a little bit easier and save you admin time. If you have already setup the Microsoft security groups please skip this step.

Create permission groups as security groups.
Go to Microsoft admin > active teams and groups > security groups:

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 5.1 Question 1: Can I use the template file for other SharePoint pages?

- **Answer:** Yes, this template file can be used to easily duplicate the folder structure and access rights for other SharePoint sites. You will save a lot of time by doing so.

### 5.2 Question 2: Do I have to create Microsoft security groups?

- **Answer:** No, you can also create just the SharePoint groups. If you frequently work with the same user groups, it is worthwhile to create security groups to manage users more efficiently.
